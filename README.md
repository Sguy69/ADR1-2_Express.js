## ADR 1: Adoption of Express.js as the Web Framework

# Context
Our application necessitates a server that is both lightweight and flexible, capable of efficiently handling API requests and supporting rapid development cycles. It is essential for the server to integrate seamlessly with Node.js and to support middleware for tasks such as request processing, routing, and error handling.

# Decision
We have decided to adopt Express.js as our primary web framework for developing the RESTful API backend of our application.

# Rationale
Performance and Efficiency: Express.js is renowned for its performance, handling HTTP requests and responses with minimal overhead, which is crucial for our application's responsiveness.
Flexibility: Its unopinionated nature allows for the freedom to structure the application based on our specific needs, utilizing the best architectural patterns and third-party middleware.
Rich Ecosystem: Express.js boasts an extensive ecosystem, including a wide range of middleware and strong community support, enabling easy addition of functionalities like body parsing, session management, and security features.
Ease of Use and Learning Curve: The simplicity of Express.js, along with its comprehensive documentation and tutorials, makes it an ideal framework for our team, ensuring quick onboarding and development.
Consequences

Pros:

Enhanced application responsiveness and efficiency.
Flexibility in application structure and middleware integration.

Cons:

Necessitates proficiency in Node.js and asynchronous programming patterns.
Requires careful evaluation of middleware for security, performance, and maintenance implications.

## sample code

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World with Express.js');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});



## ADR 2: Structuring the Application Using MVC Pattern with Express.js
# Context
Anticipating the growth in complexity of our application, we require a scalable and maintainable architecture. A clear separation of concerns is essential for efficient development among different teams.

# Decision
We have opted to structure our Express.js application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

# Rationale
Separation of Concerns: MVC enhances modularity by dividing the application into three interconnected components, simplifying management and scaling.
Ease of Maintenance: This pattern facilitates updates and maintenance of each component independently, reducing the risk of unintended side effects.
Enhanced Collaboration: MVC supports parallel development, allowing for faster development cycles and improved team collaboration.
Framework Support: Express.js natively supports the MVC pattern through its routing and middleware functionalities, easing the implementation.
Consequences

Pros:

Improved modularity and ease of application scaling.
Simplified maintenance and updates.

Cons:

Requires adherence to the MVC pattern, potentially necessitating training.
Evaluation and integration of templating engines for view rendering might be needed.

## sample code

// app.js - Entry point
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
// MVC components
const routes = require('./routes'); // Controller
app.use('/', routes);
app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server started'));

// routes/index.js - Controller example
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
router.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('MVC with Express.js'));
module.exports = router;

// Further model and view examples would be structured similarly.
